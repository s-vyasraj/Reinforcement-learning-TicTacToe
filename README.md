# Reinforcement Basics-learning-TicTacToe
This is an assignment from my Reinforcement learning class (@IISc).  

Agent/Environment/Reward/State/Policy are fundamental constructs of a RL engine. For this problem:
  a) Agent - Computer  (Player 1: Computer, Player2: Computer with random action)
  b) Environment - TTT board
  c) State: {TTT board has 9 squares - hence independent observation, which captures position values in each of the squares)
  d) Policy: Picks an action with probability (1-epsilon) maximizes Reward, with P(epsilon) a random action Epsilon values (0.1, 0.05}
  e) Reward:  <Code compares 2 reward schemes>
  f) Value function:
